# Mixed Reality Deckdown

Welcome, we are team Monomon and we made Mixed Reality Deckdown - a two-player colocated physical combat demo in mixed reality. 

## Shared Spatial Anchor and Colocation

We used Meta's Shared Spatial Anchor API to enable a colocation experience. In order to enable SSA and colocation features for your device, create an issue to contact repo owner to get your Meta account added to the release channels so you can experience colocation in our game.
